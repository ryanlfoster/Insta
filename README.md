Insta
=================

My InstaDMG AddOns.

pkgmaker - older packagemaker formats.
pkgbuild - the new kid on the block, this is the one that I will be updating moving forward.

NOTES : 

- I build these for my workflow, I try to make it as VANILLA as possible, I don't use MCX though, so I do modify the User Template.

REDUNDANT (pkgmaker formats)
- Scripts use a naming convention so you can easily identify stuff.
- Folders labelled XXXPayload correlate to the XXX.sh script in the same dir.
- Scripts labelled with LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon create these to execute at startup. (mainly to write ByHost prefs etc).
